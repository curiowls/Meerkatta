# schools — College List Building Workflow

Use `references/admissions-knowledge.md` for school type comparison matrix, holistic review criteria, demonstrated interest tracking, college list building structure, and fit evaluation dimensions. Use `references/cross-cutting.md` for spike development and narrative threading modules.

---

### Step 1: Gather Preferences

Collect the student's priorities through open-ended questions. Ask one at a time:

1. **Size**: "What size school feels right to you? Small (under 3,000 students — you'll know people in your classes), medium (3,000-10,000 — balance of community and options), or large (10,000+ — huge range of majors, clubs, and anonymity)? Or not sure yet?"
2. **Location**: "Where do you want to be? Close to home, a specific region, or open to anywhere? Urban, suburban, or rural campus? Does weather matter to you?"
3. **What matters most**: "What do you want your college experience to feel like? Think about: small seminar classes vs. big lectures, research opportunities, sports culture, Greek life, specific programs, campus vibe, diversity, study abroad."
4. **Schools on radar**: "Are there any schools you're already thinking about? Even if it's just a vibe — 'I liked the campus' or 'my cousin went there' counts."
5. **Budget**: "I want to make sure we're realistic about cost. Is financial aid a major factor, are you looking for merit scholarships, or is cost not the primary concern?" Respect privacy — don't push if the student is uncomfortable. Note: even families who think they can't afford private schools are sometimes surprised by financial aid. "Some private schools with big endowments can actually be cheaper than state schools after aid. Let's not rule anything out yet."

If the student already has preferences in state from a previous session, pull them: "Last time, you mentioned you liked [X]. Still true?"

If the student says "I don't know" to any question, that's valid. Offer categories to react to rather than forcing a choice: "That's totally fine. Let me describe a few types of schools and you can tell me what sounds appealing or what definitely doesn't."

### Step 2: School Type Education

Briefly walk through the major school types using the comparison matrix from `references/admissions-knowledge.md`. Don't lecture — present it as a comparison the student can react to:

| Type | Size | Class Feel | Best For |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Ivy / Elite Private** | Medium | Mix of seminars and lectures | Broad intellectual ambitions, network |
| **Top Tech** (MIT, Caltech, Georgia Tech) | Small-Large | Small to medium, hands-on | Deep STEM passion, maker culture |
| **Large State University** | Very large | Large lectures, smaller recitations | Budget-conscious, wants many options |
| **Liberal Arts College** | Small | Small seminars (10-25) | Wants mentorship, intellectual exploration |
| **Art / Design School** | Small-Medium | Very small, studio-based | Creative career path, portfolio-driven |

After presenting, ask: "Which of these feels most like what you're looking for? And is there anything that's definitely NOT what you want?"

Help the student understand "fit": "Fit isn't about prestige — it's about where you'll actually thrive. A student who wants close faculty mentorship might be miserable at a 50,000-student university, even if it's highly ranked. And a student who wants lots of major options might feel constrained at a small liberal arts college. Neither is better — it's about what works for you."

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Build a categorized list using the student's preferences, academic profile, and spike:

1. **Cross-reference criteria**: Match the student's size/location/vibe preferences against their GPA, test scores (if available), activities, and intended major/spike area.

2. **Use WebSearch** to find schools matching the criteria. Search for specific combinations: "[major] programs at [size] [type] schools in [region]", "colleges known for [specific interest/activity]", "schools with strong [program] and [characteristic]."

3. **Categorize into reach/match/safety** (pull structure from `references/admissions-knowledge.md`):
   - **Reach (2-3)**: Acceptance is uncertain based on the student's profile — aspirational but not impossible
   - **Match (4-5)**: Profile aligns well with admitted student data — reasonable expectation of acceptance
   - **Safety (2-3)**: High confidence of acceptance AND the student would genuinely attend

4. **For each school**, provide: why it might be a good fit (connecting to the student's stated preferences and spike), and what to investigate further.

5. **Safety school principle**: "A safety school has to be a place you'd actually want to go. If you'd be miserable there, it's not a real safety — it's just a backup you'll resent. Let's find safeties you'd genuinely enjoy."

6. **Common list-building mistakes to avoid** (flag if observed):
   - All reaches, no safeties
   - Choosing by name recognition alone
   - Ignoring financial reality
   - No diversity by school type
   - Not considering actual preferences (location, size, culture)

### Step 4: Fit Assessment Per School

For each recommended school, walk through four dimensions of fit (from `references/admissions-knowledge.md`):

1. **Academic fit**: Does the student's GPA and test score range fall within or near the school's middle 50%? Is the intended major/program strong at this school? Are there specific research opportunities, honors programs, or academic features that match?

2. **Activity/spike fit**: Does the school value the student's areas of depth? Are there clubs, teams, research groups, or programs that match the spike? Would the student be able to continue and deepen their core activities?

3. **Cultural fit**: Size, location, campus vibe, social scene, diversity, Greek life presence, residential experience. "Would you feel at home here?"

4. **Financial fit**: Estimated net price (recommend running the school's net price calculator), merit scholarship availability, need-based aid generosity. "We'll get more specific on costs when we run `financial`, but let's flag any obvious concerns now."

Present the fit assessment as a conversation, not a report. For each school: "Here's why I think [School] could work for you: [2-3 specific connections]. The thing to investigate further is [1 specific question]."

### Step 5: Demonstrated Interest Strategy

Explain demonstrated interest and build a targeted plan (from `references/admissions-knowledge.md`):

1. **What it is**: "Some schools quietly track how much interest you've shown — email opens, campus visits, event attendance, interview participation. It can genuinely affect admission decisions at schools that care about it."

2. **Who tracks it and who doesn't**:
   - **Cares significantly**: Many liberal arts colleges, mid-size private universities, schools with lower yield rates
   - **Generally doesn't care**: Ivy League, large public universities, schools with very high yield
   - "We should focus your demonstrated interest energy on schools that actually track it."

3. **Build the DI action plan for each school that tracks it**:
   - Sign up for the mailing list and open emails
   - Attend virtual info sessions and webinars
   - Visit campus if possible (always sign in at admissions)
   - Accept interviews — always, even if "optional"
   - Connect with admissions reps at college fairs
   - Follow up after visits with a brief thank-you email
   - Write strong, specific "Why Us" supplemental essays

4. **For schools that don't track it**: "You don't need to stress about demonstrated interest for [Ivies/large publics]. Your application speaks for itself there."

### Next Steps
- Research: [specific programs, professors, or features to look into at 2-3 schools]
- Visit: [which schools to visit, virtual or in-person]
- Financial: [which schools to run net price calculators for]

**Recommended next**: `financial` — let's run net price calculators for your top choices and check scholarship options. **Alternatives**: `apply` (if junior/senior, to plan application strategy), `essays` (if junior+, to start brainstorming your personal statement), `help`
```

### State Update

Write to the **College List** section of `counseling_state.md`:
- Each school with: name, category (reach/match/safety), type, strategy (to be filled by `apply`), demonstrated interest actions, fit notes, financial estimate (to be filled by `financial`)
- Populate demonstrated interest actions for schools that track DI

Update **Active Counseling Strategy** if college list building shifts the focus area.

If the student reveals preferences or emotional patterns during this workflow (e.g., "parent wants me to go to [school] but I don't"), capture in **Coaching Notes**.
